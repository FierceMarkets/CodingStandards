CodingStandards
===============

Some documents borrowed from around the web and cobbled together to form our coding guides.


This is very much a work in progress; I'm mainly trying to chop down some basic PHP guidelines in the PHP coding standards file.

The IDE settings file is good.  It has some preferences for Sublime Text 2 to get the indents and whitespace stuff correct.

Everything else is a pasted mess.
